	 * This is so we have more information about a member leaving the audience in the `removeMember` event.
	 *
	 * It allows us to match the behavior of the `addMember` event where it only fires on a change to the members this
	 * class exposes (and would actually produce a change in what `getMembers` returns).
	 *
	 * It also allows us to provide the client details in the event which makes it easier to find that client connection
	 * in a map keyed on the `userId` and not `clientId`.
	 *
	 * This map will always be up-to-date in a `removeMember` event because it is set once at construction and in
	 * every `addMember` event. It is mapped `clientId` to `M` to be better work with what the {@link IServiceAudience}
	 * events provide.
